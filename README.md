- LSTM implementation in RUST for sequencing data from genomics and prediction of the sequence classifiers.

- A week ago i put a post on BlueSky as how you can implement LSTM in RUST and today i
  finished a part of coding a LSTM model in RUST.
- Implementing the LSTM neural network in RUST on the sequence data. 
- A complete LSTM coded this evening (4.5 hours offline) and implemented in RUST. 
- I only write the sequence and image based machine learning in RUST for biological analysis 
  and currently converting all my previous python coded to RUST. 
- Next I am writing the last part of the neural network and that is GRU as i wrote the LSTM, CNN, RNN already. 
- All of them use different approach and highgly scalable using RUST. 
- Few more to write so that it gets embedded in my head. 
- Libraries that I am using Burn, TCH, PyTorch, Candle( I will write the language models 
  only for the genomic BERT and training).
  Previously used Keras and Tensorflow in Python also but not anymore. If needed then can use.
